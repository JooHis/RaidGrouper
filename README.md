# RaidGrouper
A tool to manage raid groups in wow classic



HOW TO USE:

Type "/rg" ingame to bring up the UI.

Type names in the groups you want them to be in.

Click "Fix groups!" button as people join the raid. Addon will attempt to place them in the groups you have set.

If the groups/raid is full, the addon cannot fix this. This is due to blizzard protecting some of the API calls.
You will have to either kick people and re-invite them, or just do the groups manually.
